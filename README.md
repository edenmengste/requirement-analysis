# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository aims to explore the critical process of requirement analysis within software development. It provides insights into effectively gathering, documenting, and managing project requirements to ensure successful software delivery.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle that focuses on understanding and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new software system. It involves:

*   **Elicitation:** Gathering information from various sources (users, clients, domain experts) to understand their problems, goals, and desired functionalities.
*   **Analysis:** Examining the collected requirements to identify inconsistencies, ambiguities, and missing information. This also involves prioritizing requirements based on business value and technical feasibility.
*   **Specification:** Documenting the agreed-upon requirements in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner. This typically results in artifacts like Requirement Specifications Documents (RSDs) or User Stories.
*   **Validation:** Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' true needs and are testable and achievable within project constraints.

The primary goal of requirement analysis is to lay a solid foundation for the subsequent design, development, and testing phases, minimizing misunderstandings and ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.
